# Raptors Word Guess Game

[Live](https://yukanishijima.github.io/word-guess-game/)

This is a classic hangman inspired word guess game. Let’s guess Toronto Raptors players’s names who won their first NBA championship in 2019! We the North! 

## Site Functionality and Features

- The game begins once a user presses any key. When user guesses a correct letter, the page will reveal it by replacing an underscore with the correct letter. 

- A user has 20 guesses for each question, which counts down as a user presses a letter on the keyboard. 

- The game tracks user’s wins and losses. 

- Once a user solves a player’s name, an image of the player will be shown on the page dynamically by JavaScript. 

- The game is fully responsive for mobile and laptop, however it can’t be played on a mobile as the requires key enters.
